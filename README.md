# Advanced JAVA Exercises

This repository contains a collection of **advanced Java programming exercises**, designed to strengthen knowledge and application of Java concepts in real-world scenarios. The exercises focus on topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, multithreading, and advanced Java features.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Implement advanced OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
  - Use interfaces, abstract classes, and inner classes effectively.

- **Data Structures**:
  - Explore and implement data structures like arrays, lists, sets, maps, and custom structures.

- **Multithreading**:
  - Work with Java's multithreading capabilities, including threads, synchronization, and concurrent utilities.

- **Exception Handling**:
  - Master custom exception creation and comprehensive error handling.

- **Advanced Java Concepts**:
  - Utilize streams, lambdas, and functional programming features in Java.
  - Apply design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and Observer.

## Project Structure

- **Exercises**: Java files organized into directories based on topics.
- **Solutions**: Example implementations and solutions for each exercise.
- **Documentation**: Comments and explanations within the code to guide learning.
